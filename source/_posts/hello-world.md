## Where has TYPOS been?
Pretty much through with publishing. We realized in July before making issue 7 that the magazine was kinda becoming our life. While it was fun, we have different goals with our lives. So we decided to put 'er down nice 'n' easy-like.

## What is TYPOS?
It's an online blog for us and our friends (who feel like still publishing stuff) to churn out story ideas and share our content into the void that is the WWW.

## Goals this time?
Not many.

1. Publish stable blog with no targeted number of posts
1. Publish the first 6 paper issues online via posts and full issues in epub/kindle formats
1. Read our magazine on our Kindles

## How to submit content?
Find out and let me know.
