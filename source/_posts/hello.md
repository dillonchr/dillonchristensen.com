Dear log, I started out thinking that making a personal blog would be fun. I thought it'd be a great opportunity to try something new out. How did it go?

Goodly! I decided to learn webpack for myself. I use it in all my react projects but they're so cookie cutter that create-react-app does the trick for me. Good. Well learning it should be easy. All it takes is time. Haha, so na√Øve. But learning one thing is boring. Let's learn a new framework too! Choo.js is here to stay!

Getting webpack to pull in tachyons was my first issue. Just pull in the CSS man, include it in the bundle. No css imports outside of JS. That's how I do it with react, so why should I stop now?
